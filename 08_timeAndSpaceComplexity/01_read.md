## time complexity

- amount of time taken by algorithm to run as function of length of input

## space comlexity

- amount of spaces taken by algorithm to run as function of length of input

## units

- O - big o - upper bound (worst case)
- theta @ - average bound (avg case)
- omega - lowerbound (best case)

## big o

- constant time = O(1) 
like int a = 5; int arr[3] ;

- linear time = O
like in loop works till N

- quadratic time = O(N^2)
like in one loop works till N and under nested loop it works till N

- cubic time = O(N^3)
like in one loop works till N and under nested loop it works till N and under second loop another nested loop works till N

- logarathmic time = O(log N)
like in binary search


## some functions

- f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n
- see always upper bound ignore constant time
- O(2n^2)
- ignore constant time
- O(n^2)

<br/>

- 4n^2 + 3n^3
- O ( 4n^2 )
- O ( n^2 )

<br/>

- n^2 + log n
- O(n^2)

<br/>

- 200
- O(200)  // constant time

- n/4
- O(n)

## least or most complex in big O
