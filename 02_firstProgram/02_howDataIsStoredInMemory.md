![2s-complement_3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85551636-5ae9-4aac-8721-44dccae6317c)

- here in summation 1+1 = 10 (2) 

- datatype is imp because it define how many bytes we need to read from memory and type of data

## signed vs unsigned data

- signed = -ve, 0 ,+ve
- unsigned = +ve only
